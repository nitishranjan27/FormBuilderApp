# Form Builder App

This is a Form Builder application built with **React**, **React Router**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The application allows users to create custom forms with multiple question types (Text, Grid, Checkbox) and upload images for both the form header and individual questions.

## Features

- **Form Creation**: Users can create forms by adding questions, selecting question types (Text, Grid, Checkbox), and uploading images for questions.
- **Header Image**: Users can upload an image to display at the top of the form.
- **Form Preview**: Users can preview the form once itâ€™s created and view the questions with images if uploaded.
- **Save Form Responses**: Responses to the form can be saved and retrieved from the backend.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Form data, including questions, answers, and images, are stored in MongoDB.
